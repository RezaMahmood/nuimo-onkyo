Work in Progress

The idea is to hook up a Nuimo (https://www.senic.com/) to a Raspberry Pi and use it to control an Onkyo receiver.

This project uses the Nuimo/RPi library (https://github.com/getsenic/nuimo-raspberrypi-demo) together with the onkyo-eiscp (https://github.com/miracle2k/onkyo-eiscp)

To run: python nuimo-onkyo.py
